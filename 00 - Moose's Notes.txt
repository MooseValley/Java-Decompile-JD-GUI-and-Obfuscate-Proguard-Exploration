Java - Decompile (JD-GUI) and Obfuscate (Proguard) Exploration

with Moose O'Malley

* Start with a really simple Java GUI application
Create a JAR - basic editor and command line commands !
No Maven, no Gradle, no Netbeans, no Eclipse, etc
so we can explore the commands and see what's going on.

* Decompile it and compare
JD-GUI:	https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui

* Obfuscate the compiled code with Proguard
Proguard:	http://proguard.sourceforge.net/
* Decompile the obfuscate build and compare

* Barely scratched the surface ?  Want me to go deeper ?
Other decompilers ?  Other Obfuscaters ?

Part 1. The Simple GUI App

Part 2. Compiling the App /
creating a JAR

Part 3. Decompiling the original compiled code (JAR)

using JD-GUI

Part 4. Obfuscating the compiled code (JAR)


using: Proguard
Part 5. Decompiling the oeiginal JAR and the obfuscated JAR and comparing the results

using JD-GUI
6. Why obfuscate ?

Why bother protecting YOUR hard work ?
